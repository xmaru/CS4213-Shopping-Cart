# CS 4213 – Design Patterns Prototype

Mini **Shopping Cart** web app built with **React + Vite** to demonstrate multiple design patterns:

- **Strategy** – discount rules (no discount, percent discount, etc.)
- **Factory Method** – creating product objects
- **Observer** – updating cart total when items change

## Project Goal

This prototype is for **CS 4213 – Software Design Patterns**.  
It is not a full e-commerce site. The focus is to show:

- How each pattern improves **maintainability, flexibility, and clarity**
- Before vs. after pattern refactor
- Ability to explain patterns in an interview-style Q&A

## Tech Stack

- React + Vite
- JavaScript (ES6)
- CSS (minimal)

## Running the Project
